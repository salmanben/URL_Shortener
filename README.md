## About the Project
This URL Shortener application allows users to shorten long URLs into short. 
Users do not need to sign up for an account to use the service.
Instead, a uniqueID is generated for each user when they access the application for the first time.
This uniqueID is stored locally on the user's device using local storage and is utilized each time the user accesses the application.
The uniqueID is used to fetch, delete, and store data in the MySQL database associated with the shortened URLs.
